# EKrut - Online Food Machine

EKrut is a Distributed Food Machine

It was created in my 5th semester as part of the "Middle" project.

EKrut is an online food machine, that utilize the OSCF java API, along side JavaFX, ScenceBuilder and more external API's.

The project was created in 3 stages:

1) Getting the story from user, creating requirements and UML diagrams.

2) Creating Package diagram and prototype.

3) Hard coding of the project.

The project mimics an online food machine where customers can place order, managers can also view reports and much more.
